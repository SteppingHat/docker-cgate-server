Description:
In normal use, the PROJECT LOAD command should be used instead of DBLOAD to
  open project databases.
Loads a project database into C-Gate in the current project.
This makes the database the active project database for the current project.
If and only if the filename given has an extension of ".zip", C-Gate will
  attempt to uncompress a ZIP archive containing the XML tag database.  If the
  extension ".gz" is given, C-Gate will attempt to use GZIP to uncompress the
  file before reading.  If any other extension is given, or no extension is
  given, then the file is assumed and expected to be in an XML form, though
  C-Gate does not assume a .XML extension.
If the filename is an absolute path, then the file will be loaded from that
  absolute filename.  If a relative path is given, then the path will be
  relative to the path given in the tag-base-directory property.

  address on the far side of the bridge device. A path longer than 6 bridges
  will not be returned.
With the OID option given, a series of OIDs are given for all the networks
  in the path, including the ending network, but not the source network in one
  or more 137 responses.
With the COMPACT option given, a compact bridge path hex string is returned
  in a single 136 response.
The OID option is the default if no option is given

Description:
Re-addresses a <Network> in the project database, and additionally ensures
  that and other <Networks> that are of the bridge type have any references to
  the old network corrected to support the new network.  Re-addressing means
  that the network's <Address> element is given a new value.
Warning:  This command does not prevent you from re-addressing a network to
  be the same address as another existing network.  This could be confusing if
  used with reckless abandon.
~#~

  that the network's <Address> element is given a new value.
There are some business rules check before renaming the network and the
  ruels are:
- db-net-address and new-net-address must be string representations of
  decimal number (i.e. only 0~9 is allowed)
- new-net-address can not be the same as db-net-address 
- new-net-address must be within the range of [0, 255]

   The tag database is saved in the archive as an entry called 'tagdb.xml' and
  is the only entry in the archive.
- If the extension given is .gz the tag database will be compressed using
  GZIP.
Otherwise, the file is saved in XML format.  The files will only be saved
  with an extension of .xml if this is given in the filename.

Syntax:
DBSETXML db-address << end-tag
Description:
Sets a part of the current Tag Database as a snippet of XML given after the
  command issued. The db-address given is any object in the XML database, and
  can be specified as either a path from the base of the tag database (ie
  /Installation/InstallationDetail/Installer), a C-Bus network address, a tag
  name or OID.

  failure; 4 = extreme failure
Description:
Sends an error report to the network using the Error Reporting Application.
Note that EREPORT MESSAGE does not yet implement any of the error-reporting
  constraints enforced by some of the devices - it will allow you to send
  messages that are syntactically incorrect. This allows it to be more
  flexible during the transition to a new error reporting protocol.
Messages received with an $05 or $15 header will continue to produce the old
  status change message, unchanged. However, they will no longer produce a
  level 8 event message.
~#~
EVENT
Syntax:
EVENT ON | OFF | event-mode
event-mode = "e" (IDIGIT | '+' ) "s" DIGIT "c" DIGIT
Description:
Controls the output of events, status change and config change information
  to the command session that the command is executed in.
EVENT ON will  turn on the output of events only with no prefix on each
  event.  This is the same as event-mode e+s0c0.
EVENT OFF disables event output. This is equivalent to setting an event-mode
  of e0s0c0.
(Can also use the command EVENTS.)
Event Modes:
Giving an event-mode expression can give find grained control of event
  output.  An even mode is made up of a set of  identifiers and an event level
  for each identifier.
For events, the identifer is: e and valid event levels are + and 0 through
  9.  In this case, the event level  indicates the maximum level of events
  that will be displayed. When these events are delivered, they show a prefix
  of #e#.  The '+' level is a special code to indicate that no prefix is to be
  used and the default event level of C-Gate object are used.
For  status change events, the identifier is s and valid events levels are 0
  and 1 corresponding to disabled and enabled.  When these events are
  delivered, they are prefixed with #s#.
For  config change events, the identifier is c and valid events levels are 0
  and 1 corresponding to disabled and enabled.When these events are delivered,
  they are prefixed with #c#.
Console
The console is opened in event mode e+s0c0.  This can also be changed by
  command.
~#~

  object. The special parameter ?? returns one line for each parameter with a
  desciption of the parameter.
(Can also use the SHOW command.)
~#~
GETSTATE
Syntax:
GETSTATE (network-address | cgroup-name)
Description:

  current status of a connected network. Events are returned for all devices
  in the network.  Events are returned giving:
- status information for all units and groups 
- level information for all groups and terminals
This command is an easy way for an application to get the current state of
  the network as a starting point for a model or for subsequent event tracking
  or polling.

?  can be used as an abbreviation of HELP.
~#~
DBCREATE
Syntax:
DBCREATE
Description:
Generates a tag database that represents the current connected C-Bus
  networks & C-Gate implementation.  This replaces the current tag database.
So, to capture the state of the network and store it, perform a DBCREATE
  then a DBSAVE  command to save the database to disk.
This command creates a new database, which fills in compulsory elements with

net-address = address of the network
unit-addresses = comma delimited sequence of unit addresses, or *
Description:
Interrogates unit addresses to determine whether there are single or
  multiple units at each address.
This command performs a single MMI followed by parallel queries to all unit
  addresses in question.  The entire process takes about two seconds to run.
If the unit-addresses parameter is not provided or is a * wildcard, all
  occupied addresses in the MMI will be queried.
Each response line will begin with either "Duplicate units detected",
  "Single unit detected", "Single unit with error detected", "One or more
  units detected", "One or more units with error detected" or "No units
  detected", and then be followed by the text " at address: xxx".
~#~
NET CLOCKS
Syntax:
NET CLOCKS net-address [target | R]
net-address = address of the network
target = the target number of enabled clocks to achieve
R = a constant to perform an emergency recovery of clock only
Description:
This command is used for managing the number of C-Bus clocks enabled on the
  network.  Not to be confused with the CLOCK commands.
The command has three different behaviours depending on the target parameter.
If the target parameter is:
- not supplied, then the command returns a list of the unit addresses that
  have C-Bus clock enabled.  This also includes additional information showing
  the clock generator and the software burdens enabled.
- an integer, then C-Gate will if needed enable or disable additional clocks
  in order for the network to reach the target number of clocks enabled.  This
  may take several seconds.
- the letter 'R', the command will perform an emergency recovery by enabling
  clock on the gateway.  This takes less than a second.  Note that C-Gate also
  has an automatic clock recovery feature that achieves the same outcome.
In all cases the command requires the network to be open first.
The standard recommendation is that each C-Bus network should have three (3)
  clocks enabled.
WARNING: This command does not take into account network topology.  The best
  practice is to enable clocks on units located in the physical centre of the
  network topology and to achieve that you will need to program units
  individually.  However this command will always attempt to keep existing
  clocks enabled, so if you have enabled two clocks by hand and you specify a
  target value of '3', it will preserve the original two enabled clocks and
  enable one more.

Description:
Defines a C-Bus network to add to the current project. This creates the
  network in state new in the current project. This command also will create
  an entry for this network in the project tag database, if tag databases are
  being used. An event is sent on the creation of a network by this mechanism.

interface-address = address of the interface to use, in the form type@address
Description:
Returns the project name of the C-Bus network attached to the specified
  interface.
~#~
NET RENAME
Syntax:
NET RENAME net-address new-net-address ["nofixrefs"]
net-address = address of the network to be renamed/readdresses
new-net-address = new address for the network
"nofixrefs" prevents the command from changing bridge definitions in other
  networks in this project to support the new network name.
Description:
Re-addresses a network, giving it a new name and address.
This takes place immediately.
This command also updates any references to the old network address in any
  bridge networks unless the optional nofixrefs is given at the end of the
  command. The network address of the bridge network can only be updated when
  the network is not open, and if this command fails to update the network
  address, there will be a message in the response that the network address is
  not changed.
Note: This command doesn't affect or rename the database instance.
~#~
NET SAVE
Syntax:
NET SAVE DB | FILE [project]
project = the name of a project
Description:
Saves the network configuration for the given project to either the project
  database, or to a networks file appropriate to the project.   If no project
  name is given, then the current project is used.  The current project is
  determined by the command session that this command is issued in - see the
  PROJECT USE command for details of setting the current project. Note: this
  command does not save a project database to disk -- this is done with the
  PROJECT SAVE command.
~#~
NET SET_PROJECT_IDENTIFY
Syntax:
NET SET_PROJECT_IDENTIFY net-address project-name
net-address = address of the network to be identified
project-name = new project name, must be no more that 8 characters and
  conform to the sixbit packing standard
Description:

~#~
NET SYNC
Syntax:
NET SYNC net-address ["fast"] [retry-count]
net-address = address of the network to be synchronised
retry-count = number of retries for commands during the sync process
Description:
Initiates a network synchronisation operation, returning a number of lines
  of status information as the synchronisation succeeds.  Applications can use
  this progress information to present progress graphics or show a status
  screen of some kind if required.
If the optional parameter 'fast' is given, the sync only completes an MMI,
  type, version and serial number scan before returning. This gives a quick
  view of a network.
If a retry-count is given, then the network's Retries parameter is set to
  this value for the duration of this command.
Note: if another sync of the same network is in progress, either a
  background sync or a sync started by 'NET SYNC' command, the sync command
  will attach itself to the on going sync and respond with the cached sync
  outputs in the beginning followed by the remaining outputs as a normal sync
  operation.
Note: the background sync is explained in Starting a Project or Network. The
  background sync is controlled by network's AutoSync property which should
  always be set to yes as explained in Starting a Project or Network. It is
  not necessary to turn off AutoSync for C-Bus Toolkit, Schedule Plus and
  other C-Gate clients to work properly. Network's NextSyncTime property
  indicates when the next scheduled automatic background sync will be
  executed.
~#~
NET SYNCNEW
Syntax:
NET SYNCNEW net-address [unit-number]
net-address = address of the network to do a syncnew operation on
unit-number = (optional) specific unit address to check
Description:
Checks a network or a single unit address to see if there are any new units.
If no unit number is given, the command checks for any new units on the
  network and if they are found, returns the type, version and serial number
  for the units.
If a unit number is given, the command check for a new unit at that address,
  also checking to see if any duplicate units are found at that address.
~#~
NET UNRAVEL
Syntax:
NET UNRAVEL net-address [matchdb]
net-address = address of the network
matchdb = if specified, units will be moved to their database addresses
  where possible
Description:
Performs a series of operations on a network to find all units and where
  necessary move them to unique addresses.  This is a necessary operation to
  commission a C-Bus network, as all units invariably come from the factory
  set to address 255.
The unravel process will:
- Perform an MMI to find occupied addresses.
- Interrogate the gateway unit and ensure no other units are at that address.
- If the gateway unit is a bridge, move it to the correct address matching
  the near side network.
- Interrogate each remaining unit address.  If duplicates are found, they
  will be moved to unique addresses.
- If 'matchdb' is specified and a matching unit is found in the database,
  ensure the unit ends up at that address.
- Leave one unit at each originally occupied address.  This ensures an
  already unravelled network will not change if it is unravelled again.
- Move all other units to vacant  addresses starting at 2 and increasing.
- Cope with old units without serial numbers (though it will proceed slowly
  at these addresses).
Typical responses are:
120-completed MMI 1 of 1.
120-Unravel: Unit count: <count>
120-Unravel: Units at: <comma delimited addresses>
120-Unravel: Unravelling gateway units...
120-Unravel: Top unit was sent to <address> (<hex-address>).
120-Unravel: Restored top unit to address <address> (<hex-address>).
120-Unravel: Scanning unit <no> of <count> at <address> (<hex-address>).
120-Unravel: Unit at address <address> (<hex-address>) with serial number
  <serial> moved to address <address> (<hex-address>).
120-Unravel: Unit at address <address> (<hex-address>) moved to address
  <address> (<hex-address>).
120-Unravel: Last unit at address <address> (<hex-address>) with serial
  number <serial> left in place.
120-Unravel: Complete.
120-Unravel: Updating network model at address <address> (<hex-address>)
200 OK.
Note that there is also a NET UNRAVELUNIT command that allows you to specify
  a subset of addresses to be unravelled.

Possible values for <OnlineStatus> are:
- new: as defined in the network property <DBUnitAddressesNew> 
- missing: as defined in the network property <DBUnitAddressesMissing> 
- online: as defined in the network property <DBUnitAddressesOnline> 
- error: as defined in the network property <DBUnitAddressesError> 
- duplicate: as defined in the network property <DBUnitAddressesDuplicate> 
- unknown: this status is not defined and one possible reason is that the
  unit address is not in the project database or the MMI report but it has
  been seen by C-Gate at least once since the project is opened in C-Gate,
  e.g. a unit is plugged into the network then unplugged while it is not in
